## Wafer Production System : Modelling and Verification

Present here are files created as part of the System Validation project for Q1 2018-19 by @evil-scientist and team.
The aim of the project is to design, verify and test a controller for Industrial transfer system for silicon wafers

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing and verification purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to install mcrl2 to replicate our results.

After installing, either use our Makefile or run the following command.
```
mcrl2-gui
```

## Running the tests

To run the automated tests for this system, use the Makefile provided.

The following creates all of the required files
```
make all
```

Then you can execute: 

```
make sim
make view
```
for simulation and visualization of the system.

The following will test all of the Î¼ calculus formaluae
```
make tests
```
Once finished, run
```
make clean
```
This will remove all intermediate files

## Deployment

The project has been tested on 
* Windows 10, Intel i-core i7, 2.8GHz processor with 16GB RAM 
* Xubuntu (18.04), Intel i-core i5, 2.8GHz processor with 8GB RAM

Clone the repository on to your machine, install mcrl2 and run the Makefile as instructed.
